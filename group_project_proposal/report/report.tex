\section{Motivation}

The market price is determined by the demand and supply of traders in the market. In this group project, the team will be tackling Ethereum market price by estimating if the future price increases or decreases based on text processing sourced from the web such as social networking sites, news sites and forums. The problem will be converted into a classification problem by comparing the future next market price with the current market price instead of a regression problem of estimating the future market price. Can news or posts of Ethereum articles really affect the market price?

\section{Dataset}

Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange containing many popular cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), etc. The market price of ETH will be sourced from the platform and some processing to convert the continuous value to discrete positive (+1) and negative (-1) class labels for the project. Binance provides a set of API \footnote{\url{https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/web-socket-streams.md}} and WebSocket endpoints available for the team to collect the data.
